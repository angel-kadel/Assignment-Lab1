Node.js is a runtime environment for executing JavaScript code outside the browser, built on Chrome's V8 engine. It enables server-side scripting, making JavaScript a full-stack language. With its non-blocking, event-driven architecture, Node.js is ideal for scalable applications like real-time chats and APIs. It uses npm (Node Package Manager) to manage dependencies efficiently. Popular frameworks like Express.js simplify backend development. Node.js supports asynchronous programming with promises and async/await. Its lightweight and high-performance nature makes it a top choice for modern web development.
